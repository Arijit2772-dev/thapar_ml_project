 #filters the DataFrame, keeping only rows where the condition is True.
    else :
        return df[df['user'] == selected_user].shape[0]
    
creating a boolean mask...

df['user'] == selected_user
→ creates a Boolean mask like:

[True, False, True, False, ...]


where True means that row belongs to the selected user.

df[df['user'] == selected_user]
→ filters the DataFrame, keeping only rows where the condition is True.

.shape[0]
→ counts how many rows remain = total messages sent by that user.

basically crewtaing a mask... 
the


// app.py is streamlit code...
with keyword makes it much more pythonic...
