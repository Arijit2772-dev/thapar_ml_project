Some manufacturers, like LaptopwithLinux, offer warranties that remain valid even if you upgrade or modify your device with Linux. In fact, LaptopwithLinux provides a 2-year warranty on laptops and a 3-year warranty on Intel NUC (Linux Mini) devices. They also guarantee that the chosen Linux OS will work with the product for at least the lifetime of the chosen OS version.\n",

      "\n",
      "- *Warranty Period*: Typically 2 years for laptops and 3 years for Intel NUC devices\n",

      "- *Self-Repair and Upgrades*: May void warranty if not done properly\n",
