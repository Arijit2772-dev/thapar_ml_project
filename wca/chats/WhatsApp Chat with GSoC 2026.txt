Let's not treat GSoC as something which is only meant for stipend but really get meaningful contributions to meaningful organisations. 
I was looking for organisations that participated in GSoC 2025 and they all are brilliant organisations having such a big impact on us. What do you guys think ?
24/08/2025, 09:31 - +91 81042 05239: Absolutely 💯 
Looking at the much larger picture will help us focus better on the work than on the paycheck
24/08/2025, 09:33 - +91 70376 23988: Sure! the main purpose of GsoC to give us real life experience not a gig to make money

25/08/2025, 13:08 - +91 70456 38616: Time Constraints, i guess
25/08/2025, 13:08 - +91 70376 23988: Yeah when i start coding its more fun then i thought
25/08/2025, 13:09 - +91 70376 23988: that would be another reason
25/08/2025, 13:09 - +91 81294 12156: Understandable
25/08/2025, 13:09 - +91 70376 23988: But when its come to backend 😶
25/08/2025, 13:10 - +91 81294 12156: I mean once you get the flow of data , it's pretty straightforward
25/08/2025, 13:11 - +91 81294 12156: Designing backends is more frustrating than developing it
25/08/2025, 13:11 - +91 70376 23988: Looking forwerd to my better future
25/08/2025, 13:12 - +91 81294 12156: It will be awsome👍🏻
25/08/2025, 13:12 - +91 70376 23988: but in my prospective its not gonna frustrate me like math questions im confident
25/08/2025, 13:13 - +91 81294 12156: Probably, I stopped looking into maths after calculus -2 <This message was edited>
25/08/2025, 13:13 - +91 81294 12156: Linear algebra is fun though
25/08/2025, 13:14 - +91 70376 23988: Not that much in finel sem and there is another final boss is mechanics
25/08/2025, 13:15 - +91 81294 12156: Oh
25/08/2025, 13:15 - +91 70376 23988: the concepts is too damn hard
25/08/2025, 13:15 - +91 70376 23988: doing 100+ questions to solve one question in exam
25/08/2025, 13:15 - +91 81294 12156: Damn
25/08/2025, 13:15 - +91 81294 12156: Atleast for programming, basic maths and common sense will suffice
25/08/2025, 13:17 - +91 70376 23988: yeah i know that programming concepts is hard but its nothing against what i witness for whole three semesters
25/08/2025, 13:17 - +91 81294 12156: Haha
25/08/2025, 13:18 - +91 70376 23988: seriously in starting i love maths but when the time change i starting to feel frustrated that i can't keep up
25/08/2025, 13:19 - +91 70376 23988: that why coding way too much fun
25/08/2025, 13:19 - +91 81294 12156: I think almost every subject has a point after which it becomes too serious and the fun aspect needs to be redefined
25/08/2025, 13:20 - +91 70376 23988: no physics is way too easy in whole dgree period😆
25/08/2025, 13:20 - +91 81294 12156: Same goes for coding, it's a game ,  you enjoy until you hit the hard levels , but when you overcome it , it feels great
25/08/2025, 13:20 - +91 81294 12156: My colleague is loosing his mind on physics, he would say otherwise
25/08/2025, 13:21 - +91 70376 23988: will see in future
25/08/2025, 13:21 - +91 70376 23988: i don't know maybe i was loving the wrong subject whole time😁
25/08/2025, 13:47 - +91 82922 51435: Ye sab ke jagah maybe we can talk gsoc. I mean group is for gsoc why discuss basic stuff
25/08/2025, 13:50 - +91 94323 86627: Why not it's for community building and seeking clarity as well <This message was edited>
25/08/2025, 13:51 - +91 82922 51435: It's distracting. I mean I don't wanna know what subject you have in your graduation. Just mention where do you want to contribute what tech stack is relevant etc.
25/08/2025, 13:52 - +91 82922 51435: I just want the group to be focussed.
25/08/2025, 13:52 - +91 81294 12156: My first message in the group was asking this same question,
25/08/2025, 13:53 - +91 82922 51435: ??
25/08/2025, 13:53 - +91 81294 12156: Treat it as a long icebreaker

Quick intro about me..

I’m Birajit, currently stepping into my 2nd year of CS. I’m a GSoC’25 contributor with Jenkins, wrapping up my project this October. It’s been a solid journey so far.

Outside OSS and dev, I’m super curious about research, especially around AI, ML, and the more theoretical side of AGI.

I’ll be around to help out if you hit any roadblocks or hiccups during your journey

It will be best if everything happens in this group just how open source works



And now in aug sep no need to panic anyone you all can now focus more on skills and acads

And start preparing for gsoc from november or if you want october


Treat gsoc like a fun game not like something to crack but something to give your best to learn and achieve
30/08/2025, 11:20 - +91 85058 56478: Bhaiya aapka tech stack kya hai?
30/08/2025, 11:20 - +91 78284 34498: I am in first year cse and only know html , so how to start preparing for gsoc ( I mean which language to start)
30/08/2025, 11:21 - +91 97075 78703: Meine college ke alaba jo jenkins mein chhaiye toh time ke through kiya tha


Thats best way 
I mean its depends invidually


But other than mostly mere college main first year main sab cover kar diye the toh thoda easy lag gaya feb march enter hone ke time tak
30/08/2025, 11:21 - +91 97075 78703: Jenkins  ke jis repo main kam kiya usme
30/08/2025, 11:22 - +91 85058 56478: Aapne contribution kis month se start Kiya tha
30/08/2025, 11:22 - +91 97075 78703: I was in same position last year this time


So ample time

Just  give time to it
30/08/2025, 11:23 - +91 97075 78703: Meine december se kiya mera first Pull request merged dec hua and gsoc ke selection ke pehle tak mera 42 merged hua tha
30/08/2025, 11:23 - +91 85058 56478: Damn!! 42!!!!
30/08/2025, 11:23 - +91 85058 56478: Top contributor aap hi honge
30/08/2025, 11:24 - +91 97075 78703: Maybe
30/08/2025, 11:25 - +91 97075 78703: But 42 nehi chhaiye

Below 20 enough even if org is powerful


And agar less popular org toh usme contributions se bhi jyada proposal matter karta hain
30/08/2025, 11:25 - +91 78284 34498: So which language is best to open source
30/08/2025, 11:25 - +91 97075 78703: 1-4 PR contribute agar ho jaye toh uske baad OSS addiction ho jayega
30/08/2025, 11:26 - +91 97075 78703: Dont compromise acads (mainly attendance) 

I did it but wont suggest to do that

30/08/2025, 23:31 - +91 97075 78703: The hidden reason of not preferring indian maintainers is like


Some of the students like us get a maintainers role if they do gsoc previously

And sadly some  of them do biasness in selection selecting their own college people

This is sad but it's happening india
30/08/2025, 23:32 - +91 97075 78703: Not all but few of them doing this so better not take risk



I am saying only for lead mentors

Not co mentors

Co maintainers can be anyone
30/08/2025, 23:32 - +91 77190 14887: I don't think so. He kept saying do what you and maintainers are comfortable with
30/08/2025, 23:33 - +91 81042 05239: That's rampant in India 🇮🇳 in like every other department . Corruption is everywhere in India 
We will have to accept that

30/08/2025, 23:34 - +91 97075 78703: Thats i why i suggest to do gsoc as fun part of your life

Not something you are competing but something you are collaborating
30/08/2025, 23:35 - +91 81042 05239: Its a lore in India 🇮🇳 which everyone can share
30/08/2025, 23:35 - +91 85058 56478: Bhaiya gsoc projects bhi alag alag type ke hote  hai na?

08/09/2025, 12:24 - +91 97075 78703: In git journey while doing Pr and solving issues or anything only very few of them would be mostly in use


Better to get involved with the commands practically
08/09/2025, 12:26 - +91 97075 78703: And one more hint while getting any errors in git commands


Its better to copy and paste the error in google to get stack overflow answers since they are much more easy and simple 

Rather than asking LLM they give most of the times the harder way

I have worked mostly on C/C++ (Working on an Operating System in C). I also have a decent level of experience in Rust as well. Apart from embedded systems my interest lies in Machine Learning, Compilers (Not an expert tho) and stuff. I have also been doing full stack web development and game development. Any suggestions for the organisations that I should target ? I am a beginner in Open Source Contributing so suggest accordingly. <This message was edited>

12/09/2025, 20:11 - +91 79033 07775: Btw like what actually is devops and what people do on a daily basis.. I tried to understand it multiple times but still couldn't able to understand it <This message was edited>
12/09/2025, 20:11 - +91 79033 07775: Explain me like I am 5 yr old
12/09/2025, 20:13 - +91 99743 98796: I learned java , HTML CSS and now completling javascript
12/09/2025, 20:13 - +91 89578 11952: Ok bro I know
12/09/2025, 20:13 - +91 99743 98796: Targeting GSoC 2026
12/09/2025, 20:13 - +91 89578 11952: At the start I was also confused 😕
12/09/2025, 20:13 - +91 89578 11952: Let me explain
12/09/2025, 20:14 - +91 79033 07775: Ok :)
12/09/2025, 20:15 - +91 89578 11952: Great me too
12/09/2025, 20:22 - +91 89578 11952: So basically devOps actual pe kya hai jaise ...ye cheez new hai mtlb kaafi old nhi ye last 10 years se hi hai ...ispe hota kya 
Soch tum aur tumhare dost ek app bana rahe ho jaise game ya photo editing app normally developer code likhta hai aur system wala banda us code ko computer pe deploy karta hai taaki log use kar sake lekin problem yeh hoti hai ki naye features aate hain ya bugs fix karne hote hain toh baar baar manually sab karna padta hai jo time waste aur error prone hota hai yahi pe DevOps aata hai DevOps engineer aise tools aur scripts banate hain jo yeh sab kaam automatically kar dete hain jaise naye code ko turant test karke server pe deploy kar dena aur system ko 24 7 monitor karna ki sab sahi chal raha hai ya nahi Roz ka kaam code ko smoothly chalana bugs ko fast fix karna naya feature deploy karna bina app band kiye system ki health check karte rehna jaise tum ghar ka electric system aisa bana do ki light khud on off ho jaye fan speed khud adjust ho jaye bina tumhare action ke waise hi DevOps makes software smart aur automatic taaki developers sirf naye ideas pe focus kare aur system khud chalti rahe bina kisi  tension ke .... Jaise tumhare Android phone pe auto Update kaise ajate hai ? Bina developer ke pass phone gye !! Aur ek dum smoothly....pehle ye manually hota tha devOps se pehle bht time consuming and error bht hote the isliye devOps ka concept aya ..
12/09/2025, 20:23 - +91 79033 07775: Seems interesting 🤔
12/09/2025, 20:24 - +91 79033 07775: Thoda complex hai par kaafi useful hai
12/09/2025, 20:25 - +91 89578 11952: Yes start pe bht theoretical way pe pdhoge to boring lgega
12/09/2025, 20:25 - +91 89578 11952: When you start making mini project and start using tools it seems interesting 😅
12/09/2025, 20:26 - +91 79033 07775: Aise koi samjhaya hi nahi mai devops ko hamesha aws aur docker wagera se jodta tha
12/09/2025, 20:30 - +91 89578 11952: Are wo AWS to cloud infrastructure ko manage krne ke liye hota hai docker ( came from the ship dock jaha saman load hoke idhar se udhar jata hai same wahi kaam docker ka portability ka) kubernetes se container ko efficiently manage krte hai ....overall ye sb tools hai devOps concept pe ( CI/CD ) ke liye
12/09/2025, 20:30 - +91 79033 07775: Ig we learn something new daily 😅

13/09/2025, 22:10 - +91 96014 83320: Devops
13/09/2025, 22:10 - +91 72093 61161: For devops you should have atleast some knowledge of web dev
13/09/2025, 22:10 - +91 79033 07775: Devops is niche compare to webdev

13/09/2025, 22:17 - +91 63622 28473: But i heard devOps has fewer opportunities compared to full stack.
13/09/2025, 22:18 - +91 79033 07775: Ain't it more like a senior role?
13/09/2025, 22:18 - +91 88827 45233: guys i am very new to tech world but basic of C++ i want to do GSoc project having laguage of C++ can anyone let mw know how an i start plss
13/09/2025, 22:19 - +91 72093 61161: At beginning level, getting opportunity as devops engineer is difficult
13/09/2025, 22:19 - +91 63622 28473: Yeh true, devOps comes after some experience not usually for freshers
13/09/2025, 22:19 - +91 79033 07775: Ha that's what I heard
13/09/2025, 22:20 - +91 72093 61161: Learn c++ very well, search for projects in cpp on gsoc website, start contributing
13/09/2025, 22:23 - +91 88827 45233: i done basic ,STL and OOPS topic do u feel i am ready for basic project to contribute?
13/09/2025, 22:24 - +91 72093 61161: Yes, learn by contributing

13/09/2025, 22:43 - +91 99183 62188: Can you learn devops before web dev
13/09/2025, 22:43 - +91 79033 07775: Basic web dev is needed
13/09/2025, 22:44 - +91 89578 11952: Yes, but I have prior knowledge of web dev that's why I didn't faced any problem
13/09/2025, 22:45 - +91 89578 11952: Go ahead , you'll not face any problem regarding it
13/09/2025, 22:46 - +91 99183 62188: I am learning backend for now in node
13/09/2025, 22:46 - +91 89578 11952: Yes bro , when you start contributing you'll gain experience,, not only about the project but also about the concept basic and the most important is git and GitHub ✨
13/09/2025, 22:47 - +91 89578 11952: Great bro keep going
13/09/2025, 22:47 - +91 99183 62188: Thanks
13/09/2025, 22:54 - +91 63622 28473: Yo! No one here just something i came across
13/09/2025, 22:55 - +977 976-5826617: Idk, i feel devops is something that senior webdevs do automatically
13/09/2025, 22:56 - +977 976-5826617: good developers can become excellent devops engineer
13/09/2025, 22:57 - +91 89578 11952: Yeah it's true at start you'll get less oportunity but it doesn't mean devOps is not better carrier it depends on your skills how perfectly you have mastered.. market of web dev is saturated nowadays...but in devOps there still less learners ✨
13/09/2025, 22:57 - +91 63622 28473: Makes sense..so in a way devOps isn't separate at the start.
13/09/2025, 22:57 - +91 89578 11952: Yes it is practicing a certain skill over period of time makes you skillful ✨
13/09/2025, 22:58 - +977 976-5826617: no, idk i hear people say you dont need web dev knowledge to become DevOps engineer...
13/09/2025, 23:00 - +977 976-5826617: but its so wrong, when you know what is in the code, you can operate it very well
13/09/2025, 23:01 - +91 89578 11952: Bro devOps isn't all about coding it's about automation 😐
13/09/2025, 23:02 - +977 976-5826617: I work in a place, where i started as frontend dev but now i do work with docker, have proper cloud knowledge,  good understanding of CI/CD
13/09/2025, 23:02 - +91 63622 28473: Right, Ig DevOps is more about system, cloud and automation skills than   just WebDev,
13/09/2025, 23:02 - +977 976-5826617: i haven't finished my talk yet, so
13/09/2025, 23:03 - +977 976-5826617: so as a developer, i felt this is a lot easier when you know whats in the code
13/09/2025, 23:03 - +977 976-5826617: in real life it wont be like, i know only this ...so i will work with this
13/09/2025, 23:04 - +977 976-5826617: they will throw random never seen problems and expects you to fix it
13/09/2025, 23:05 - +977 976-5826617: so i say atleast have some knowledge of webdev, you dont need it but it can be very helpful
13/09/2025, 23:10 - +91 88827 45233: Thanks buddy

I started with React,Django(+drf),sql and in holidays I joined GenAI cohort and with that did Fastapi and now college everyone says interns or opensource where only django has choice while stopped GenAI thinking not much and messing things very much
Any suggestions
16/09/2025, 14:04 - +91 80741 07291: Even apart from opensource
16/09/2025, 14:06 - +91 89578 11952: It's common with everyone
16/09/2025, 14:06 - +91 89578 11952: So you have to stick to one firstly
16/09/2025, 14:06 - +91 99743 98796: Very Relatable Bro. I am also messing up everything Web dev,DSA and Ai So I picked one thing at time and Don't changed that
16/09/2025, 14:07 - +91 99743 98796: I only do Web Dev and College stuff
16/09/2025, 14:07 - +91 99743 98796: I also Wanted to start DSA but things messed so I cant do it
16/09/2025, 14:09 - +91 89578 11952: I suggest you to go with django +react+sql only genai and fastapi are not for beginner friendly as you are aiming for internship ...learn these three and build project..as you get internship for side learning genai and fastapi cause you can't get internship quickly from these ..
16/09/2025, 14:09 - +91 89578 11952: Which sem?

16/09/2025, 15:29 - +91 94323 86627: Update the Discord link I think it is not working
16/09/2025, 15:30 - +91 70156 58627: that makes sense


But the thing is like I m not able to decide a endpoint/goal for next 2 months

Too much uncertainty, should I do this or that.

Can you suggest something like this is enough to be call myself capable

18/09/2025, 17:27 - +91 77190 14887: Well, that way we Indians are not away from being banned. We saw who expressjs repo was filled with spam readme updates by dumb students watching apna college course. It led to such an embarrassment
18/09/2025, 17:29 - +91 99743 98796: Yes...very rude things

18/09/2025, 18:10 - +91 92168 63374: I need suggestion ,
Which is best for dsa apna college or striver's
18/09/2025, 18:11 - +91 77190 14887: I don't want to demotivate you but I personally don't like apna college and some other Indian youtubers because they give a rat race feeling. It gives me some jee trauma which I am recovering from. Hence, i follow others. For web dev , I have followed foreigners. And for dsa I am doing striver sheet
18/09/2025, 18:16 - +91 93293 17835: One thing i wanted to ask though, I'm interested in tech startups and stuff, but yeah as it's the first year in college so should I go for dsa as it's the need rn or should I go for something else to get into the startup thing
18/09/2025, 18:17 - +91 93293 17835: Actually they won't be asking dsa in the first year obviously but there's obviously the feeling that maybe I'm falling behind
18/09/2025, 18:17 - +91 74889 63230: I think just explore everything that you can in your first year.
18/09/2025, 18:18 - +91 93293 17835: The thing is these dsa lectures are pretty long, so I don't want to start something and then leave it in between you see, so I'm confused about how to explore correctly without leaving something in between
18/09/2025, 18:19 - +91 77190 14887: Not everything but a few things. Read and watch videos about everything but start doing something apart from college whether it is web dev or dsa. Choose one. I started with web dev and now I will be doing dsa. Continuing web dev I will be doing Gen ai with js or golang
18/09/2025, 18:19 - +91 94323 86627: And you need to be consistent with dsa otherwise you will forget
18/09/2025, 18:20 - +91 93293 17835: Yeah exactly what I'm thinking
18/09/2025, 18:20 - +91 62010 06188: U can do  usaco guide for cp
18/09/2025, 18:20 - +91 93293 17835: Web dev or dsa, which one should be started first
18/09/2025, 18:20 - +91 94323 86627: Dsa
18/09/2025, 18:20 - +91 81042 05239: Wow! Nice alternative. 
I won't waste my 7k for 8 months. If I need more I will ask u
18/09/2025, 18:20 - +91 77190 14887: I did web dev but dsa is not bad either
18/09/2025, 18:21 - +91 93293 17835: I see
18/09/2025, 18:21 - +91 77190 14887: I have also started dsa (very early currently on pattern printing). I am following striver

26/09/2025, 21:10 - +91 99743 98796: If you switch to Linux, your warranty availability depends on the manufacturer's policies. Some manufacturers, like LaptopwithLinux, offer warranties that remain valid even if you upgrade or modify your device with Linux. In fact, LaptopwithLinux provides a 2-year warranty on laptops and a 3-year warranty on Intel NUC (Linux Mini) devices. They also guarantee that the chosen Linux OS will work with the product for at least the lifetime of the chosen OS version.

However, it's essential to review the warranty conditions and terms before making a purchase or switching to Linux. Some warranties might be voided if damage occurs due to self-repair, hardware upgrades, or improper use.

*Key Points to Consider:*

- *Warranty Period*: Typically 2 years for laptops and 3 years for Intel NUC devices
- *Warranty Conditions*: Vary by manufacturer, so review terms carefully
- *OS Support*: LaptopwithLinux guarantees Linux OS compatibility for the chosen version's lifetime
- *Self-Repair and Upgrades*: May void warranty if not done properly

To confirm warranty details, it's best to contact the manufacturer directly or review their documentation . META AI <This message was edited>

All of these are programs where you  make useful open source contributions (usually in areas like fixing software bugs, improving websites, or working on backend systems) and receive a stipend for the same.

These contributions are part of what’s called open source development.
